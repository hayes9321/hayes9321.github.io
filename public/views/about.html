				<p><b>Hi, I'm Travis</b>, a developer based in Seattle Washington.
				I am curious by nature, I often find myself taking things apart to see how they work and brainstorming what would make that object better? As a Software Developer I use this natural curiosity to fuel my creative outlook on a project, and work through problems.

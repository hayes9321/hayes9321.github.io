		<p><b>Hi, I'm Travis</b>, a developer based in Seattle Washington.
		I am curious by nature. I often find myself taking things apart to see how they work and brainstorming what would make that object better. As a Software Developer I use this natural curiosity to fuel my creative outlook on a project, and work through problems.
